# Tiny Tales
Tiny Tales is an Android app and educational tool that supports creative storytelling in young children.

Children between the ages of two and five are actively developing their language skills every day. Many products and tools are available to help young learners develop their phonics and letter recognition skills, but few value developing their storytelling and creative abilities.
Our team aims to address this problem space of early childhood language development, storytelling, and creativity with an engaging and easy-to-use app that gives children tools to become creators of personally meaningful stories.
